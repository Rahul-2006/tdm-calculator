	<p>&quot;Parking Provided / Baseline&quot; displays a percentage derived
  by dividing your project&apos;s parking supply by the number of spaces indicated in
  the &quot;Citywide Parking Baseline&quot; row.
  A reduction of at least 10% (when &quot;Parking Provided / Baseline&quot; is 90% or less) results
  in points earned through the &quot;Reduced Parking Supply&quot; strategy. Providing 110%
  or more of the Baseline results in increased Target Points for the project.

		Reduction in parking supply below the generalized Citywide Parking Baseline, using parking 
    reduction mechanisms
		including, but not limited to, TOC, Density Bonus, Bicycle Parking ordinance, locating in an Enterprise
		Zone or Specific Plan area, or compliance with zoning regulations that require
		less parking than the generalized Citywide Parking Baseline. Points are also awarded for projects

  A reduction of at least 10% below the Citywide Parking Baseline (when &quot;Parking Provided / Baseline&quot; is
  90% or less) results in points earned through this strategy.
